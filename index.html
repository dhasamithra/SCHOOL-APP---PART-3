She acts predominantly in Malayalam language, in addition to Telugu, Tamil, Hindi, Kannada and English language films. She has won two National Film Awards, one Kerala State Film Awards and numerous other awards.<br><br>Shobana established herself as a leading actress in 1980s and 1990s. She was very successful and was bored of working in Telugu movies, so she took a vacation and started working with Malayalam industry. She has worked with directors such as Adoor Gopalakrishnan, G. Aravindan, K. Balachander, AM Fazil, Mani Ratnam, Padmarajan, Bharathan, Uppalapati Narayana Rao, and Priyadarshan. She won the National Film Award for Best Actress twice, for her performances in the Malayalam film Manichitrathazhu (1993) and the English film Mitr, My Friend (2001). Consequent to the year 1999, Shobana turned extremely selective about her films.
